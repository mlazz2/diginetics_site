        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Claims Frequency Modeling</h3>
                <p>Based on proven results in healthcare prediction, the platform could discover which behavioral patterns and external factors are genuine leading indicators of claims activity vs. noise, identifying which policyholders are most likely to file claims and when.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Loss Ratio Drivers</h3>
                <p>Which factors actually drive loss ratios for specific product lines? The platform's proven ability to discover specific, quantified relationships suggests it could uncover connections between policyholder attributes, market conditions, and claims outcomes that go beyond generic actuarial tables.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Risk Segmentation</h3>
                <p>Just as the platform found that different MLB players need completely different strategies, this capability could apply to policyholder data, discovering natural risk segments that don't map to pre-defined categories.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="section-label">Why This Is Feasible</div>
        <h2 class="section-title">What we've already proven that applies directly to insurance.</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Insurance is fundamentally a prediction problem: estimate future claims from historical data. Our healthcare deployment already solved a closely related problem on 101,766 real patient encounters.</p>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Healthcare Rate Prediction: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>The platform predicted hospital readmission rates within 0.02 percentage points on 101,766 patient encounters. Insurance claims prediction is structurally identical: predict a rate (claims frequency) from a population (policyholders) using historical data (claims history + risk factors). The 0.18% error achieved in healthcare demonstrates the platform's capability on exactly this type of problem.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Autonomous Risk Driver Discovery: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>In healthcare, the platform independently discovered that high glucose prevalence and demographic factors drive readmission, without being given any clinical hypotheses. This proven capability could apply to insurance, autonomously discovering which policyholder attributes, behavioral patterns, and external factors drive claims, without needing actuaries to specify what to look for.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Per-Entity Risk Profiles: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>60 MLB players each received unique performance drivers. Different policyholders have fundamentally different risk profiles driven by different factors. This proven capability suggests the platform could produce per-segment (and eventually per-policy) risk models that identify the specific drivers for each risk class automatically.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Explainability for Regulators: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>Every prediction the platform makes comes with a transparent causal explanation. Insurance regulators (Solvency II, IFRS 17, state DOIs) increasingly require model explainability. The platform doesn't produce black-box scores. It produces specific, auditable reasoning: "this policy is high risk because of X, Y, and Z, with these specific magnitudes."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Compound Risk Interactions: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>24% of discovered relationships in baseball were multi-factor interactions. Insurance risk is notoriously multi-factor: a policyholder's risk depends on the interaction between age, location, claims history, coverage type, and external conditions simultaneously. Single-factor actuarial models miss these. This suggests the platform could capture compound risk interactions that improve pricing accuracy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Regime Transition Detection: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>73,076 regime transitions detected in baseball. Insurance portfolios undergo analogous regime shifts: a hard market transitions to soft, catastrophe frequency changes, and loss development patterns shift. This proven capability suggests the platform could detect these transitions early enough to inform reserve adjustments and pricing changes before losses materialize.</p>

    <section>
        <h3 class="results-section-title">Where This Could Apply</h3>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Auto Insurance: Telematics-Based Risk</h3>
                <p>Driving behavior data (hard braking, speed patterns, time-of-day driving) could serve as a genuine leading indicator for claims frequency, or some commonly tracked telematics signals may be correlated noise. Based on proven results separating true drivers from coincidence, the platform could distinguish causal factors from spurious patterns in telematics data.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Homeowners: Climate Risk Pricing</h3>
                <p>Climate change is repricing property risk in real time. The platform's proven ability to quantify causal relationships suggests it could measure how specific climate indicators (flood frequency, wildfire proximity, hail corridor exposure) transmit to claims severity for specific property types in specific geographies, replacing broad actuarial zones with per-property risk signals.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Life Insurance: Mortality Driver Discovery</h3>
                <p>Based on proven results discovering clinical readmission drivers in healthcare data, the platform could discover which combinations of medical, behavioral, and socioeconomic factors are genuine mortality predictors for specific age cohorts in life insurance data.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Workers' Compensation: Industry-Specific Claims Patterns</h3>
                <p>Different industries have fundamentally different injury profiles. The platform's proven ability to build per-entity models suggests it could discover industry-specific claims drivers that improve loss prediction beyond generic NCCI class codes, identifying which workplace conditions actually lead to claims vs. which are theoretical risks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Reinsurance: Catastrophe Correlation Discovery</h3>
                <p>Catastrophe risk is driven by correlations between perils that traditional models may not capture. The platform's proven compound-interaction discovery suggests it could find hidden correlations between natural catastrophe events, economic conditions, and aggregate loss patterns across cedant portfolios.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Fraud Detection: Behavioral Leading Indicators</h3>
                <p>Based on proven results discovering causal chains in baseball, the platform could identify which sequences of policyholder behaviors serve as leading indicators for fraudulent claims, discovering the behavioral "attack chains" that precede fraudulent filings.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

                <h3>Life &amp; Health Insurance</h3>
                <p>Discover which clinical and behavioral factors actually predict mortality and morbidity risk. The same platform that found high glucose prevalence as a readmission driver in healthcare could apply directly to life underwriting.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Reinsurance</h3>

            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Regulatory &amp; Compliance</h3>
                <p>Every prediction and pricing decision comes with transparent, auditable reasoning. Built for Solvency II, IFRS 17, and state regulatory requirements. Replace "the model says so" with "here's exactly what drives this price."</p>
