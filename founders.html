Led the system through three industry deployments (baseball, retail, and healthcare), each achieving 97%+ accuracy with zero code changes. Responsible for the technical vision, product architecture, and the R&amp;D process that turned a single-sport prototype into a universal prediction engine.</p>

            <h2>Our Thesis</h2>
            <p>Every industry has the same problem: too much data, not enough understanding of what's actually driving outcomes. We built one platform that solves this universally. The same engine that predicts Aaron Judge's home run rate predicts hospital readmission rates and retail revenue shifts. That's not a coincidence. It's the architecture.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="results-section-title">Why This Is Hard to Replicate</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 0.95rem; color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Building a prediction model for one domain is straightforward. Building a single platform that works across unrelated industries at 97%+ accuracy, without changing code, requires solving problems most teams never encounter.</p>

        <div class="moat-item">
            <div class="moat-number">1</div>
            <div class="moat-item-content">
                <h3>The results are the proof</h3>
                <p>97% accuracy across 60 MLB players. Hidden cross-sell dependencies and 3-day revenue early warnings discovered in retail. 0.18% error on hospital readmissions from 101,766 patients. Three completely unrelated industries, same platform, zero code changes. Delivering this across three domains with the same system is a fundamentally different engineering challenge, and one we've already solved.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="moat-item">
            <div class="moat-number">2</div>
            <div class="moat-item-content">
                <h3>One platform, not three products</h3>
                <p>Most AI companies build custom models per client or per industry. We deploy the same platform with a configuration change. Baseball, retail, and healthcare each required zero engineering, just a settings file defining the domain. A competitor entering one vertical starts from scratch. We're already live in three and can add a fourth in days.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="moat-item">
            <div class="moat-number">3</div>
            <div class="moat-item-content">
                <h3>Every new deployment widens the gap</h3>
                <p>Each industry deployment validates the platform's core architecture in a new context. Three successful deployments prove it's not domain-specific luck. A competitor would need to match our accuracy in one domain, then prove cross-domain generalization, then do it a third time. By then, we're five verticals ahead.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="moat-item">
            <div class="moat-number">4</div>
            <div class="moat-item-content">
                <h3>Accuracy that holds on data we've never seen</h3>
                <p>Every result on this site was measured on held-out data the system never saw during training. The baseball projections were compared against confirmed 2025 season stats. The healthcare predictions were tested on 30 unseen time windows. This isn't training accuracy. It's real-world, verifiable prediction performance. Replicating training accuracy is easy. Replicating held-out accuracy at this level is not.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="moat-item">
            <div class="moat-number">5</div>
            <div class="moat-item-content">
                <h3>Discovers insights no one was looking for</h3>
                <p>The platform doesn't just predict. It finds things. It discovered that Aaron Judge's power is driven by plate discipline, not mechanics. It found that a smoke shop's cigarette sales depend on vape traffic, not cigarette demand. It identified high glucose prevalence as a readmission driver without being told any clinical hypotheses. The discovery capability, not just prediction, is what makes the platform commercially valuable and exceptionally difficult to replicate.</p>

        <div class="disclaimer" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">
            <strong>The bottom line:</strong> Any team can build a prediction model for one domain. The defensibility of DIGINETICS is a platform that produces 97%+ accuracy across unrelated industries with zero code changes, discovers insights no one was looking for, and gets stronger with every new deployment. Matching that requires solving the same cross-domain generalization problem we've already solved, and proving it works with published, verifiable results.
