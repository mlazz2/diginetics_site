        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Threat Pattern Recognition</h3>
                <p>The platform discovers which sequences of network events are genuine precursors to breaches vs. benign noise. Just as it found causal chains in baseball (pitch environment &rarr; swing decisions &rarr; outcomes), it discovers attack chains in network telemetry.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Breach Likelihood Modeling</h3>
                <p>Continuous risk scoring based on discovered leading indicators, not static rule sets. The platform identifies which combinations of signals actually predict incidents, reducing false positives while catching real threats earlier.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Vulnerability Prioritization</h3>
                <p>Not all vulnerabilities are equal. The platform identifies which unpatched systems and misconfigurations are genuine leading indicators of breach risk vs. theoretical exposures that never get exploited in your specific environment.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3 class="results-section-title">Cybersecurity Applications</h3>
        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Security Operations Centers</h3>
                <p>Cut through alert fatigue with prioritized, explainable threat signals. The platform tells analysts which alerts to investigate first and why, backed by discovered patterns across your environment's specific telemetry.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Enterprise Risk Management</h3>
                <p>Quantify cyber risk in business terms. Map which security investments actually reduce breach probability with specific magnitudes, so CISOs can justify budgets with data instead of fear.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Managed Security Providers</h3>
                <p>Per-client threat models that adapt to each environment. The same platform discovers unique risk patterns for each customer without custom engineering, scaling your analyst capacity.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Insurance &amp; Underwriting</h3>

    <section>
        <div class="section-label">Why This Is Feasible</div>
        <h2 class="section-title">What we've already proven that applies directly to cybersecurity.</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Security threats follow causal chains with leading indicators and feedback loops. That's the same problem structure the platform has already solved in three other domains.</p>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Causal Chain Discovery: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>The platform discovered a 4-layer causal chain in baseball: pitch environment &rarr; swing decisions &rarr; contact quality &rarr; outcomes. Cyber attacks follow analogous chains: reconnaissance &rarr; initial access &rarr; lateral movement &rarr; exfiltration. We're testing whether the platform discovers these attack chains from raw telemetry without being told what patterns to look for.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Leading Indicator Discovery: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>In retail, the platform found specific metrics that predict revenue shifts 3-10 days in advance. Security incidents are preceded by anomalous behaviors (unusual login patterns, data access spikes, configuration changes) that occur hours or days before a breach escalates. We're researching whether the platform discovers these pre-breach signals with the same quantified timing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Signal vs. Noise Separation: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>The platform found that hookah sales are noise (self-contained, no cross-department impact) while vape metrics are genuine signals. SOCs are drowning in alerts where 95%+ are false positives. We're testing whether the platform separates genuine threat signals from benign noise with the same precision it achieved in retail data.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Per-Environment Adaptation: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>60 MLB players each received unique risk profiles. Every network environment is different. We're testing whether the platform produces per-environment threat models that adapt to each organization's specific architecture, traffic patterns, and attack surface without manual rule-writing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Compound Interaction Detection: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>24% of baseball relationships were multi-factor. Security breaches are rarely single-cause: a misconfiguration combined with an unpatched vulnerability combined with a phishing success creates compound risk. We're researching whether the platform discovers which combinations of security gaps create actual breach risk vs. theoretical exposure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Explainable Risk Scoring: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>Every platform prediction comes with transparent reasoning. In healthcare, it explained exactly why readmission rates behave the way they do. For cybersecurity, this means every risk score comes with a specific explanation of what's driving it, critical for audit trails, compliance reporting, and analyst decision-making.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3 class="results-section-title">Specific Areas We're Researching</h3>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Insider Threat Behavioral Patterns</h3>
                <p>We're testing whether sequences of employee behaviors (access pattern changes, off-hours activity, data download spikes) serve as leading indicators for data exfiltration, with quantified time windows between behavioral signals and actual incidents.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Ransomware Pre-Encryption Signals</h3>
                <p>Ransomware operators typically spend days to weeks inside a network before encryption. We're investigating whether the platform can discover the specific network telemetry patterns that precede ransomware deployment, giving defenders a detection window before damage occurs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Phishing Campaign Effectiveness Drivers</h3>
                <p>What makes some phishing campaigns succeed while others fail? We're researching whether the platform can discover which organizational factors (training recency, email security configuration, department-specific click rates) predict phishing susceptibility for specific teams.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Cloud Misconfiguration Risk Cascades</h3>
                <p>Cloud environments have cascading misconfigurations: an overly permissive IAM role combined with an exposed S3 bucket combined with insufficient logging creates compound exposure. We're testing whether the platform maps these misconfiguration cascades and identifies which combinations create actual breach paths.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploitability</h3>
                <p>Not every vulnerability gets exploited. We're investigating whether the platform can discover which characteristics of a vulnerability (affected system type, network exposure, exploit complexity) predict real-world exploitation probability, helping teams prioritize patching by actual risk.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Compliance Violation Enforcement Prediction</h3>
                <p>We're testing whether the platform can analyze regulatory enforcement patterns across HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, and SOX to predict which types of violations are most likely to trigger enforcement actions in the current regulatory climate, giving legal and compliance teams a data-driven prioritization framework.</p>

        <h3 class="results-section-title">Regulatory Frameworks We Cover</h3>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability &amp; Accountability Act)</h3>
                <p>Protected health information (PHI) is one of the most heavily regulated data categories. The platform analyzes access patterns, encryption status, audit log coverage, and data flow mapping to identify which specific compliance gaps carry the highest enforcement risk. Law firms can quantify exposure for healthcare clients instead of relying on generic risk assessments.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</h3>
                <p>Fines up to 4% of global annual revenue. The platform identifies which data processing activities, consent mechanisms, and cross-border data flows create the highest enforcement exposure. Discover which GDPR articles a company is most likely to violate based on their specific data architecture and operational patterns.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>CCPA / CPRA (California Consumer Privacy Act)</h3>
                <p>Consumer data rights and opt-out requirements create complex compliance obligations. The platform maps data collection practices against CCPA requirements, identifying which consumer touchpoints carry the most risk and where data retention policies create unnecessary exposure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)</h3>
                <p>Financial data integrity and internal controls. The platform analyzes access patterns to financial systems, change management logs, and separation-of-duties enforcement to identify which SOX controls are genuinely effective vs. creating compliance theater without reducing actual risk.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)</h3>
                <p>Cardholder data protection across all 12 PCI DSS requirement families. The platform identifies which requirements are most frequently the root cause of breaches in specific industries and which compensating controls actually reduce risk vs. which are paper exercises.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>State Privacy Laws (VCDPA, CPA, CTDPA, and more)</h3>
                <p>The patchwork of state-level privacy legislation creates overlapping obligations. The platform maps a company's data practices against all applicable state requirements simultaneously, identifying where a single change can resolve multiple compliance gaps at once.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3 class="results-section-title">What the Platform Delivers for Legal Teams</h3>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Quantified Compliance Gap Analysis</h3>
                <p>Not just "you're non-compliant." The platform identifies which specific gaps carry the highest enforcement risk based on discovered patterns in regulatory actions, breach data, and penalty history. Prioritize remediation by actual risk, not checklist order.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Breach Impact Prediction</h3>
                <p>When a breach occurs, how large will the regulatory exposure be? The platform models likely penalty ranges based on the type of data exposed, notification timelines, remediation speed, and the specific regulatory framework involved. Law firms can advise clients on expected financial exposure within hours of discovery.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Enforcement Pattern Analysis</h3>
                <p>Which types of companies are regulators targeting? Which violations trigger the largest penalties? The platform analyzes enforcement action history across HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, and SOX to identify which compliance failures regulators are prioritizing in the current enforcement climate.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Cross-Regulation Conflict Detection</h3>
                <p>Data retention requirements under one regulation can conflict with deletion mandates under another. The platform maps all applicable regulatory obligations for a client and identifies where requirements conflict, giving legal teams the analysis they need to advise on the safest path.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Due Diligence for M&amp;A</h3>
                <p>Acquiring a company means acquiring their compliance liabilities. The platform assesses target company data practices against all applicable regulations, quantifying hidden compliance debt that should be factored into valuation and deal structure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Incident Response Readiness Scoring</h3>
                <p>Is your client prepared for the 72-hour GDPR notification window? Does their HIPAA breach response plan actually work? The platform scores incident response readiness across each regulatory framework, identifying where response capabilities fall short before a breach tests them.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3 class="results-section-title">Legal &amp; Advisory Applications</h3>

        <div class="card-grid">

                <h3>Law Firms: Privacy &amp; Data Protection Practice</h3>
                <p>Arm your practice with quantified risk analysis for client advisory. Move beyond generic compliance checklists to data-driven gap assessments that identify which specific exposures carry the highest enforcement and litigation risk. Differentiate your firm with insights no competitor can match.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Law Firms: Healthcare Regulatory</h3>
                <p>HIPAA enforcement is accelerating. Advise healthcare clients with specific, quantified analysis of their PHI handling practices, BAA compliance gaps, and breach notification readiness. The platform identifies which HIPAA provisions your client is most likely to violate based on their operational data.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Law Firms: Breach Response &amp; Litigation</h3>
                <p>When clients call after a breach, respond with immediate, data-backed analysis. The platform models regulatory exposure, estimates penalty ranges, identifies notification obligations across jurisdictions, and flags which remediation steps will most effectively limit liability.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Corporate Legal &amp; In-House Counsel</h3>
                <p>Continuous compliance monitoring that flags new risks as regulations evolve and data practices change. The platform adapts to your company's specific data architecture and surfaces the compliance gaps that matter most, not the ones that look impressive in an audit report.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Compliance Consultancies</h3>
                <p>Scale your advisory capacity. The same platform produces per-client compliance intelligence without custom analysis for each engagement. Deploy on a new client's data environment in days and deliver quantified gap assessments that would take weeks to produce manually.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Government &amp; Regulatory Bodies</h3>
                <p>Identify which regulated entities are most likely to have compliance gaps based on discovered risk patterns. Prioritize audit and enforcement resources where they'll have the most impact on actual data protection outcomes, not just paperwork compliance.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
