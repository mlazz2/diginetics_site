        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Threat Pattern Recognition</h3>
                <p>Based on proven capabilities, we could discover which sequences of network events are genuine precursors to breaches vs. benign noise. Just as the system identified structured performance patterns in baseball, it could discover attack chains in network telemetry.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Breach Likelihood Modeling</h3>
                <p>Continuous risk scoring based on discovered leading indicators, not static rule sets. We could identify which combinations of signals actually predict incidents, reducing false positives while catching real threats earlier.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Vulnerability Prioritization</h3>
                <p>Not all vulnerabilities are equal. We could identify which unpatched systems and misconfigurations are genuine leading indicators of breach risk vs. theoretical exposures that never get exploited in a specific environment.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3 class="results-section-title">Potential Cybersecurity Applications</h3>
        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Security Operations Centers</h3>
                <p>This capability could cut through alert fatigue with prioritized, explainable threat signals. We could tell analysts which alerts to investigate first and why, backed by discovered patterns across an environment's specific telemetry.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Enterprise Risk Management</h3>
                <p>This capability could quantify cyber risk in business terms&mdash;mapping which security investments actually reduce breach probability with specific magnitudes, so CISOs can justify budgets with data instead of fear.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Managed Security Providers</h3>
                <p>Per-client threat models that adapt to each environment. We could discover unique risk patterns for each customer without custom engineering, scaling analyst capacity.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Insurance &amp; Underwriting</h3>
                <p>Data-driven cyber risk assessment for policy pricing. Discovered risk factors could provide quantified, auditable inputs for underwriting decisions instead of checkbox questionnaires.</p>

    <section>
        <div class="section-label">Why This Is Feasible</div>
        <h2 class="section-title">What we've already proven that applies directly to cybersecurity.</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Security threats follow structured patterns with leading indicators. That's the same problem structure the platform has already solved in three other domains.</p>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Track Record: Proven Across Industries</h3>
                <p>In baseball, we identified structured performance patterns. Cyber attacks follow analogous structures: reconnaissance &rarr; initial access &rarr; lateral movement &rarr; exfiltration. This suggests we could discover these attack patterns from raw telemetry without being told what to look for.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Leading Indicator Discovery: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>In retail, we found specific metrics that predict revenue shifts 3-10 days in advance. Security incidents are preceded by anomalous behaviors (unusual login patterns, data access spikes, configuration changes) that occur hours or days before a breach escalates. This could apply to discovering these pre-breach signals with the same quantified timing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Signal vs. Noise Separation: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>The platform found that hookah sales are noise (self-contained, no cross-department impact) while vape metrics are genuine signals. SOCs are drowning in alerts where 95%+ are false positives. This suggests we could separate genuine threat signals from benign noise with the same precision it achieved in retail data.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Per-Environment Adaptation: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>60 MLB players each received unique risk profiles. Every network environment is different. This suggests we could produce per-environment threat models that adapt to each organization's specific architecture, traffic patterns, and attack surface without manual rule-writing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Multi-Factor Analysis: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>24% of baseball relationships were multi-factor. Security breaches are rarely single-cause: a misconfiguration combined with an unpatched vulnerability combined with a phishing success creates compound risk. This could apply to discovering which combinations of security gaps create actual breach risk vs. theoretical exposure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Explainable Risk Scoring: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>Every platform prediction comes with transparent reasoning. In healthcare, it explained exactly why readmission rates behave the way they do. For cybersecurity, this means every risk score could come with a specific explanation of what's driving it&mdash;critical for audit trails, compliance reporting, and analyst decision-making.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3 class="results-section-title">Where This Could Apply</h3>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Insider Threat Behavioral Patterns</h3>
                <p>Based on proven pattern-discovery capabilities, we could identify sequences of employee behaviors (access pattern changes, off-hours activity, data download spikes) that serve as leading indicators for data exfiltration, with quantified time windows between behavioral signals and actual incidents.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Ransomware Pre-Encryption Signals</h3>
                <p>Ransomware operators typically spend days to weeks inside a network before encryption. Based on proven results, we could discover the specific network telemetry patterns that precede ransomware deployment, giving defenders a detection window before damage occurs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Phishing Campaign Effectiveness Drivers</h3>
                <p>What makes some phishing campaigns succeed while others fail? This capability could apply to discovering which organizational factors (training recency, email security configuration, department-specific click rates) predict phishing susceptibility for specific teams.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Cloud Misconfiguration Risk Cascades</h3>
                <p>Cloud environments have cascading misconfigurations: an overly permissive IAM role combined with an exposed S3 bucket combined with insufficient logging creates compound exposure. Based on proven capabilities, we could map these misconfiguration cascades and identify which combinations create actual breach paths.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploitability</h3>
                <p>Not every vulnerability gets exploited. Based on proven results, we could discover which characteristics of a vulnerability (affected system type, network exposure, exploit complexity) predict real-world exploitation probability, helping teams prioritize patching by actual risk.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Compliance Violation Enforcement Prediction</h3>
                <p>Based on proven capabilities, we could analyze regulatory enforcement patterns across HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, and SOX to predict which types of violations are most likely to trigger enforcement actions in the current regulatory climate, giving legal and compliance teams a data-driven prioritization framework.</p>

        <h3 class="results-section-title">Regulatory Frameworks This Could Cover</h3>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability &amp; Accountability Act)</h3>
                <p>Protected health information (PHI) is one of the most heavily regulated data categories. We could analyze access patterns, encryption status, audit log coverage, and data flow mapping to identify which specific compliance gaps carry the highest enforcement risk. Law firms could quantify exposure for healthcare clients instead of relying on generic risk assessments.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</h3>
                <p>Fines up to 4% of global annual revenue. We could identify which data processing activities, consent mechanisms, and cross-border data flows create the highest enforcement exposure&mdash;discovering which GDPR articles a company is most likely to violate based on their specific data architecture and operational patterns.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>CCPA / CPRA (California Consumer Privacy Act)</h3>
                <p>Consumer data rights and opt-out requirements create complex compliance obligations. We could map data collection practices against CCPA requirements, identifying which consumer touchpoints carry the most risk and where data retention policies create unnecessary exposure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)</h3>
                <p>Financial data integrity and internal controls. We could analyze access patterns to financial systems, change management logs, and separation-of-duties enforcement to identify which SOX controls are genuinely effective vs. creating compliance theater without reducing actual risk.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)</h3>
                <p>Cardholder data protection across all 12 PCI DSS requirement families. We could identify which requirements are most frequently the root cause of breaches in specific industries and which compensating controls actually reduce risk vs. which are paper exercises.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>State Privacy Laws (VCDPA, CPA, CTDPA, and more)</h3>
                <p>The patchwork of state-level privacy legislation creates overlapping obligations. We could map a company's data practices against all applicable state requirements simultaneously, identifying where a single change can resolve multiple compliance gaps at once.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3 class="results-section-title">What the Platform Could Deliver for Legal Teams</h3>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Quantified Compliance Gap Analysis</h3>
                <p>Not just "you're non-compliant." We could identify which specific gaps carry the highest enforcement risk based on discovered patterns in regulatory actions, breach data, and penalty history. Prioritize remediation by actual risk, not checklist order.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Breach Impact Prediction</h3>
                <p>When a breach occurs, how large will the regulatory exposure be? We could model likely penalty ranges based on the type of data exposed, notification timelines, remediation speed, and the specific regulatory framework involved. Law firms could advise clients on expected financial exposure within hours of discovery.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Enforcement Pattern Analysis</h3>
                <p>Which types of companies are regulators targeting? Which violations trigger the largest penalties? We could analyze enforcement action history across HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, and SOX to identify which compliance failures regulators are prioritizing in the current enforcement climate.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Cross-Regulation Conflict Detection</h3>
                <p>Data retention requirements under one regulation can conflict with deletion mandates under another. We could map all applicable regulatory obligations for a client and identify where requirements conflict, giving legal teams the analysis they need to advise on the safest path.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Due Diligence for M&amp;A</h3>
                <p>Acquiring a company means acquiring their compliance liabilities. We could assess target company data practices against all applicable regulations, quantifying hidden compliance debt that should be factored into valuation and deal structure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Incident Response Readiness Scoring</h3>
                <p>Is your client prepared for the 72-hour GDPR notification window? Does their HIPAA breach response plan actually work? We could score incident response readiness across each regulatory framework, identifying where response capabilities fall short before a breach tests them.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3 class="results-section-title">Legal &amp; Advisory Applications</h3>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Law Firms: Privacy &amp; Data Protection Practice</h3>
                <p>Arm your practice with quantified risk analysis for client advisory. Move beyond generic compliance checklists to data-driven gap assessments that identify which specific exposures carry the highest enforcement and litigation risk. Differentiate your firm with insights no competitor can match.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Law Firms: Healthcare Regulatory</h3>
                <p>HIPAA enforcement is accelerating. Advise healthcare clients with specific, quantified analysis of their PHI handling practices, BAA compliance gaps, and breach notification readiness. We could identify which HIPAA provisions a client is most likely to violate based on their operational data.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Law Firms: Breach Response &amp; Litigation</h3>
                <p>When clients call after a breach, respond with immediate, data-backed analysis. We could model regulatory exposure, estimate penalty ranges, identify notification obligations across jurisdictions, and flag which remediation steps would most effectively limit liability.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Corporate Legal &amp; In-House Counsel</h3>
                <p>Continuous compliance monitoring that flags new risks as regulations evolve and data practices change. We could adapt to a company's specific data architecture and surface the compliance gaps that matter most, not the ones that look impressive in an audit report.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Compliance Consultancies</h3>
                <p>Scale your advisory capacity. We could produce per-client compliance intelligence without custom analysis for each engagement&mdash;deploying on a new client's data environment in days and delivering quantified gap assessments that would take weeks to produce manually.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Government &amp; Regulatory Bodies</h3>
                <p>Based on proven capabilities, we could identify which regulated entities are most likely to have compliance gaps based on discovered risk patterns&mdash;prioritizing audit and enforcement resources where they'd have the most impact on actual data protection outcomes, not just paperwork compliance.</p>
