            <div class="card">
                <h3>Cap Rate Forecasting</h3>
                <p>Which specific market conditions cause cap rates to compress or expand, with what time delay? Based on proven results in other domains, this capability could deliver specific, quantified answers instead of generic market commentary.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>NOI Early Warning Signals</h3>
                <p>Which metrics change first before NOI moves? The same leading-indicator discovery that found 3-day and 10-day signals in retail could identify analogous timing relationships in property income data.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Per-Property Value Drivers</h3>
                <p>Just as the platform found different performance drivers for different MLB players, this proven capability could discover different value drivers for different property types and markets automatically.</p>

        <div class="section-label">Why This Is Feasible</div>
        <h2 class="section-title">What we've already proven that could apply directly to CRE.</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Commercial real estate is a time-series prediction problem with causal relationships between metrics. That's exactly the problem structure our platform has already solved three times.</p>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Leading Indicator Discovery: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>In retail, the platform discovered that disposable vape average sale predicts store-wide revenue 3 days in advance, and glass average sale predicts it 10 days out. CRE has analogous leading indicators: vacancy rate changes, lease renewal velocity, and tenant credit shifts all precede NOI movements. This proven capability could apply to finding these timing relationships automatically.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Hidden Dependency Mapping: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>In retail, cigarette sales turned out to depend on vape traffic, not cigarette demand. In CRE, office valuations may depend on remote-work adoption rates in the tenant base, not office demand metrics. This suggests the platform could discover non-obvious cross-variable dependencies in CRE, where traditional comps miss structural drivers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Per-Entity Adaptation: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>The platform produced unique performance drivers for each of 60 MLB players without being told what type of player it was analyzing. A Class A office in Manhattan and a suburban warehouse in Tampa are fundamentally different assets. This proven per-entity adaptation suggests each property could get its own causal model, not a generic sector average.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Regime Transition Detection: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>The platform detected 73,076 regime transitions across 60 baseball players, identifying tipping points between hot streaks and slumps. CRE markets undergo analogous regime shifts: from buyer's to seller's markets, from cap rate compression to expansion, from occupancy growth to contraction. This suggests the platform could detect these transitions with similar precision.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Compound Interactions: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>24% of discovered relationships in baseball were multi-factor interactions invisible to single-variable analysis. CRE valuations are notoriously multi-factor: a property's value depends on the interaction between interest rates, local employment, tenant mix, and lease terms simultaneously. Single-variable regression misses these. This proven capability could apply directly to CRE.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Zero Code Changes: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>The same platform went from baseball to retail to healthcare with only a configuration change. The data structure for CRE is different (property-level time series instead of player-level), but the underlying prediction problem is the same: discover causal relationships, find leading indicators, project forward, explain why. This suggests CRE could be the next natural application.</p>

        <h3 class="results-section-title">Where This Could Apply</h3>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Multifamily Rent Prediction</h3>
                <p>Local employment data, migration patterns, and permit activity could serve as leading indicators for effective rent changes at the property level. The same causal-chain discovery that mapped pitch environment to batting outcomes could map macro indicators to rent outcomes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Office Occupancy Regime Shifts</h3>
                <p>Post-pandemic office markets are experiencing structural regime changes. The platform's regime-detection capability, proven across 73,076 transitions in baseball, could detect when a submarket is transitioning between occupancy regimes and help predict how far the shift will go.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Industrial/Logistics Demand Cycles</h3>
                <p>E-commerce penetration rates, port throughput, and inventory-to-sales ratios may serve as upstream drivers for industrial property demand. Based on proven results—where retail revenue shifts followed specific category signals by 3-10 days—these relationships could hold with quantifiable time delays in CRE as well.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Cap Rate Sensitivity Analysis</h3>
                <p>Cap rates are influenced by interest rates, risk premiums, and growth expectations simultaneously. The platform's compound-interaction discovery could identify which combinations of macro factors drive cap rate movements for specific property types, rather than relying on generic interest-rate correlations.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Tenant Credit Risk Cascades</h3>
                <p>A single tenant default can cascade through a property's financials. Tenant-level financial signals could serve as leading indicators for property-level NOI shifts, analogous to how individual metric shifts in baseball cascade through the performance chain.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Climate &amp; ESG Risk Pricing</h3>
                <p>Flood risk, energy efficiency scores, and ESG compliance are increasingly priced into CRE valuations. The platform could quantify exactly how much these factors move value for specific property types in specific markets, replacing qualitative ESG narratives with quantified impact.</p>

        <h3 class="results-section-title">Business Applications</h3>
        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Investment Firms &amp; REITs</h3>
                <p>Identify undervalued assets where hidden drivers suggest untapped upside. Quantify the potential impact of market shifts on portfolio value before they materialize. Support data-driven acquisition and disposition decisions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Property Management</h3>
                <p>Predict occupancy and revenue trends at the property level. Identify which operational levers could actually move NOI and which may be noise. Prioritize capex where it could have the most measurable impact on value.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Lenders &amp; Underwriters</h3>
                <p>Quantified risk signals with specific time horizons. Understand which properties in a portfolio are most likely to see value shifts, and when. Move beyond static underwriting to dynamic, forward-looking risk assessment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Brokers &amp; Advisors</h3>
                <p>Arm your pitches with quantified market intelligence. Show clients specific, data-backed drivers behind pricing recommendations. Differentiate your advisory practice with insights others may not have.</p>
