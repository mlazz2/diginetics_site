        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Cap Rate Forecasting</h3>
                <p>Which specific market conditions cause cap rates to compress or expand, with what time delay? We're testing whether the platform can deliver specific, quantified answers instead of generic market commentary.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>NOI Early Warning Signals</h3>
                <p>Which metrics change first before NOI moves? We're researching whether the same leading-indicator discovery that found 3-day and 10-day signals in retail can identify analogous timing relationships in property income data.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Per-Property Value Drivers</h3>
                <p>Just as the platform found different performance drivers for different MLB players, we're testing whether it can discover different value drivers for different property types and markets automatically.</p>

        <div class="section-label">Why This Is Feasible</div>
        <h2 class="section-title">What we've already proven that applies directly to CRE.</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Commercial real estate is a time-series prediction problem with causal relationships between metrics. That's exactly the problem structure our platform has already solved three times.</p>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Leading Indicator Discovery: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>In retail, the platform discovered that disposable vape average sale predicts store-wide revenue 3 days in advance, and glass average sale predicts it 10 days out. CRE has analogous leading indicators: vacancy rate changes, lease renewal velocity, and tenant credit shifts all precede NOI movements. The platform is designed to find these timing relationships automatically.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Hidden Dependency Mapping: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>In retail, cigarette sales turned out to depend on vape traffic, not cigarette demand. In CRE, office valuations may depend on remote-work adoption rates in the tenant base, not office demand metrics. The platform's ability to discover non-obvious cross-variable dependencies is what makes it valuable for CRE, where traditional comps miss structural drivers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Per-Entity Adaptation: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>The platform produced unique performance drivers for each of 60 MLB players without being told what type of player it was analyzing. A Class A office in Manhattan and a suburban warehouse in Tampa are fundamentally different assets. The platform's ability to adapt per-entity means each property gets its own causal model, not a generic sector average.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Regime Transition Detection: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>The platform detected 73,076 regime transitions across 60 baseball players, identifying tipping points between hot streaks and slumps. CRE markets undergo analogous regime shifts: from buyer's to seller's markets, from cap rate compression to expansion, from occupancy growth to contraction. We're testing whether the platform detects these transitions with the same precision.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Compound Interactions: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>24% of discovered relationships in baseball were multi-factor interactions invisible to single-variable analysis. CRE valuations are notoriously multi-factor: a property's value depends on the interaction between interest rates, local employment, tenant mix, and lease terms simultaneously. Single-variable regression misses these. Our platform is built to find them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Zero Code Changes: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>The same platform went from baseball to retail to healthcare with only a configuration change. CRE is next. The data structure is different (property-level time series instead of player-level), but the underlying prediction problem is the same: discover causal relationships, find leading indicators, project forward, explain why.</p>

    <section>
        <h3 class="results-section-title">Specific Areas We're Researching</h3>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Multifamily Rent Prediction</h3>
                <p>We're investigating whether local employment data, migration patterns, and permit activity serve as leading indicators for effective rent changes at the property level. The same causal-chain discovery that mapped pitch environment to batting outcomes should map macro indicators to rent outcomes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Office Occupancy Regime Shifts</h3>
                <p>Post-pandemic office markets are experiencing structural regime changes. We're testing whether the platform can detect when a submarket is transitioning between occupancy regimes and predict how far the shift will go, using the same regime-detection capability proven across 73,076 transitions in baseball.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Industrial/Logistics Demand Cycles</h3>
                <p>E-commerce penetration rates, port throughput, and inventory-to-sales ratios may serve as upstream drivers for industrial property demand. We're testing whether these relationships hold with quantifiable time delays, the same way retail revenue shifts followed specific category signals by 3-10 days.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Cap Rate Sensitivity Analysis</h3>
                <p>Cap rates are influenced by interest rates, risk premiums, and growth expectations simultaneously. We're researching whether the platform's compound-interaction discovery can identify which combinations of macro factors drive cap rate movements for specific property types, rather than relying on generic interest-rate correlations.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Tenant Credit Risk Cascades</h3>
                <p>A single tenant default can cascade through a property's financials. We're investigating whether tenant-level financial signals serve as leading indicators for property-level NOI shifts, analogous to how individual metric shifts in baseball cascade through the performance chain.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Climate &amp; ESG Risk Pricing</h3>
                <p>Flood risk, energy efficiency scores, and ESG compliance are increasingly priced into CRE valuations. We're testing whether the platform can quantify exactly how much these factors move value for specific property types in specific markets, replacing qualitative ESG narratives with quantified impact.</p>

        <h3 class="results-section-title">Business Applications</h3>
        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Investment Firms &amp; REITs</h3>
                <p>Identify undervalued assets where hidden drivers suggest untapped upside. Quantify the impact of market shifts on portfolio value before they materialize. Make data-driven acquisition and disposition decisions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Property Management</h3>
                <p>Predict occupancy and revenue trends at the property level. Identify which operational levers actually move NOI and which are noise. Prioritize capex where it will have the most measurable impact on value.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Lenders &amp; Underwriters</h3>
                <p>Quantified risk signals with specific time horizons. Know which properties in a portfolio are most likely to see value shifts, and when. Move beyond static underwriting to dynamic, forward-looking risk assessment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Brokers &amp; Advisors</h3>
                <p>Arm your pitches with quantified market intelligence. Show clients specific, data-backed drivers behind pricing recommendations. Differentiate your advisory practice with insights no one else has.</p>
