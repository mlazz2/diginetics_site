        <h3 class="results-section-title">Cross-Department Revenue Drivers</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The most valuable findings were hidden relationships between departments that drive revenue decisions. These aren't correlations &mdash; they're specific, quantified connections with direct business implications.</p>

        <div class="finding">
            <div class="label">Cross-Sell Opportunity</div>
            <h3>Vape device transactions depend on cigarillo traffic</h3>
            <p>Vape device transaction volume is mathematically dependent on cigarillo basket traffic, explaining 98.5% of the variance. <strong>Business action:</strong> Co-locate these departments and run joint promotions. Cigarillo customers are vape device buyers &mdash; capture this cross-sell.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="finding">
            <div class="label">Supply Chain Risk</div>
            <h3>Cigarette sales depend on vape + cigarillo interaction &mdash; not cigarette demand</h3>
            <p>Cigarette transactions aren't self-driven. They depend on the interaction between disposable vape volume and cigarillo traffic. <strong>Business action:</strong> If vape supply drops due to a shipping delay or regulation, cigarette baskets will decline &mdash; even if cigarette inventory is fully stocked. Build this dependency into supply planning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="finding">
            <div class="label">Marketing Insight</div>
            <h3>Drink sales are pure impulse &mdash; driven by store traffic, not drink demand</h3>
            <p>Drink sales are a function of total store volume divided by checkout speed. More people moving through slowly = more impulse purchases. <strong>Business action:</strong> Drink-specific promotions won't move the needle. Increasing overall foot traffic will. Allocate marketing budget accordingly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="finding">
            <div class="label">Pricing Strategy</div>
            <h3>Glass pieces are a 1:1 category &mdash; don't bundle</h3>
            <p>Customers buy approximately 1.15 glass items per transaction, and this ratio is stable across 180 days. <strong>Business action:</strong> "Buy 2 get 1" deals won't work here. Focus on per-unit margin and upselling to premium tiers instead of volume discounts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="finding">
            <div class="label">Department Strategy</div>
            <h3>Hookah is self-contained &mdash; doesn't drive or respond to other departments</h3>
            <p>Hookah customers buy hookah products and leave &mdash; they don't cross-shop. <strong>Business action:</strong> Hookah promotions won't drive traffic to other departments. If hookah underperforms, the fix is hookah-specific. Don't waste cross-promotion budget here.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="results-section-title">Early Warning Signals</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The system discovered leading indicators with specific time delays &mdash; giving store operators advance warning of revenue shifts before they hit the P&amp;L.</p>

        <div class="finding">
            <h3>Disposable vape avg sale is a 3-day early warning for store health</h3>
            <p>When disposable vape average sale rises, the entire store's average sale follows 3 days later. <strong>Business action:</strong> Track this metric daily as an early warning system for store-wide revenue trends.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="finding">
            <h3>Glass average sale pulls the entire store upward with a 10-day lag</h3>
            <p>This is the strongest positive signal for store-wide average sale &mdash; 2.2x stronger than the disposable vape signal. <strong>Business action:</strong> Investing in premium glass pieces doesn't just improve glass department revenue &mdash; it measurably lifts the store's overall average transaction value within 10 days.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="finding">
            <h3>Cigarette-only traffic drags down store economics</h3>
            <p>More cigarette-only transactions lower the store's average sale 10 days later. Cigarette customers are low-value, single-purpose shoppers. <strong>Business action:</strong> If cigarette basket share is growing, counter by promoting cross-sell items at checkout to convert single-category visits into multi-category baskets.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="results-section-title">Prediction Accuracy by Category</h3>
        <table class="results-table">
            <tr><th>Category</th><th>Accuracy Range</th><th>High-Confidence Metrics</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Dollar Sales</td><td>95.1% &ndash; 99.99%</td><td>7 metrics</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Transactions</td><td>94.8% &ndash; 99.99%</td><td>7 metrics</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Items Sold</td><td>94.0% &ndash; 99.4%</td><td>5 metrics</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Store Totals</td><td>68.8% &ndash; 99.9%</td><td>2 metrics</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.7;">Dollar sales and transaction counts achieve very high accuracy. All categories yield actionable insights even when prediction confidence varies.</p>

        <h3 class="results-section-title">Business Applications</h3>
        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Multi-Location Retail</h3>
                <p>Deploy across multiple stores to discover location-specific revenue drivers. Each store gets its own insights while universal patterns (like impulse category behavior) transfer automatically.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Inventory &amp; Supply Chain</h3>
                <p>Cross-department dependencies mean one supply disruption can cascade across categories. Our platform maps these dependencies so you can plan proactively instead of reacting to revenue drops.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Marketing &amp; Merchandising</h3>
                <p>Know which promotions will actually move revenue vs. waste budget. Department-level insights tell you exactly where to invest marketing dollars for maximum ROI.</p>
