        <div class="section-label">Why This Is Feasible</div>
        <h2 class="section-title">What we've already proven that could apply directly to finance.</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Financial markets are time-series data with causal relationships, feedback loops, and regime transitions. That's exactly the problem structure we've solved in three other domains.</p>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Causal Chain Discovery: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>The platform independently discovered a 4-layer causal chain in baseball: pitch environment &rarr; swing decisions &rarr; contact quality &rarr; outcomes. Financial markets have analogous chains: macro conditions &rarr; sector rotation &rarr; earnings expectations &rarr; price movements. This proven capability suggests the platform could discover these hierarchies from financial data without being told what to look for.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Feedback Loops &amp; Momentum: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>The platform discovered 30,141 self-reinforcing feedback loops in baseball, explaining why hot streaks compound and slumps spiral. Financial markets exhibit the same dynamics: momentum effects, mean-reversion cycles, and volatility clustering. This suggests the platform could map these loops with similar precision in equity and fixed-income data.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Regime Transition Detection: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>73,076 regime transitions detected across 60 players: tipping points between performance phases. Financial markets undergo analogous regime shifts: risk-on to risk-off, growth to value rotation, low-volatility to high-volatility environments. This proven capability could be valuable for early detection of market regime transitions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Per-Entity Adaptation: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>Each of 60 MLB players received unique performance drivers without the platform being told their archetype. Apple and ExxonMobil are driven by fundamentally different factors. This suggests the platform could produce per-company driver models that adapt to each equity's unique characteristics automatically.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Compound Factor Interactions: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>24% of discovered relationships in baseball were multi-factor interactions invisible to single-variable analysis. Factor investing suffers the same limitation: traditional factor models test one factor at a time. This proven capability could discover factor interactions (e.g., value + momentum combined) that single-factor models miss.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Explainability Built In: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>Every prediction the platform makes comes with a clear causal explanation of what's driving it. In healthcare, it explained that high glucose prevalence drives readmission. Financial regulators (MiFID II, SEC) increasingly require prediction explainability. This suggests the platform's architecture could naturally satisfy audit-ready reasoning requirements.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3 class="results-section-title">Where This Could Apply</h3>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Earnings Surprise Prediction</h3>
                <p>Alternative data signals (supply chain metrics, web traffic, job postings) could serve as leading indicators for earnings beats and misses, with the same quantified time delays the platform discovered in retail revenue prediction.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Credit Spread Drivers</h3>
                <p>Credit spreads are influenced by default risk, liquidity, and macro sentiment simultaneously. The platform's compound-interaction discovery could identify which combinations of factors drive spread movements for specific issuers and sectors.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Sector Rotation Timing</h3>
                <p>When does money flow from growth to value, from domestic to international? Based on proven results, the platform could detect these rotation signals early by discovering leading indicators in cross-sector fund flows, yield curve movements, and economic data releases.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Volatility Regime Prediction</h3>
                <p>Low-volatility regimes transition to high-volatility regimes at specific tipping points. The platform's regime-detection capability, proven across 73,076 transitions in baseball, could identify these tipping points in VIX and realized volatility data.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>ESG Factor Materiality</h3>
                <p>Which ESG factors actually impact financial performance for which companies? The platform could separate ESG signals that genuinely predict returns from those that are correlated noise, providing the quantified materiality analysis investors need.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Macro-to-Micro Transmission</h3>
                <p>How do Federal Reserve decisions transmit through to individual company earnings, and with what delay? The platform could map the specific transmission chain from macro policy changes to company-level financial impacts, based on its proven causal-chain discovery capabilities.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3 class="results-section-title">Business Applications</h3>
        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Asset Managers &amp; Hedge Funds</h3>
                <p>Per-holding driver analysis that could reveal what's actually moving your positions. Identify regime transitions early. Quantify the potential impact of macro shifts on specific holdings before they materialize in price.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Wealth Management</h3>
                <p>Explainable investment rationale for client reporting. Show which factors could be driving performance and what's likely to drive it next. Move beyond generic benchmark commentary to specific, data-backed narratives.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Risk &amp; Compliance</h3>
                <p>Transparent, auditable predictions designed to satisfy regulatory requirements. Every forecast comes with a clear explanation of what's driving it. Built with MiFID II, SEC, and internal audit standards in mind.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Quantitative Research</h3>
                <p>Discover non-obvious factor interactions and regime-dependent relationships. The platform's compound interaction discovery could apply directly to factor modeling and alpha generation research.</p>
