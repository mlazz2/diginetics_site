                <h3>Demand Forecasting</h3>
                <p>Based on proven results finding 3-day early warning signals in retail, this could apply to procurement and logistics data, discovering analogous leading indicators that predict demand shifts before they propagate through the supply chain.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Disruption Early Warning</h3>
                <p>Which upstream metrics change first before a disruption cascades downstream? Proven ability to discover specific leading indicators with quantified time delays suggests it could identify early warning signals for supply chain disruptions.</p>

                <h3>Supplier Dependency Mapping</h3>
                <p>In retail, cigarette sales turned out to depend on vape traffic, not cigarette demand. This proven capability for discovering hidden dependencies could apply to suppliers, routes, and facilities, revealing connections that traditional risk models miss.</p>

    <section>
        <div class="section-label">Why This Is Feasible</div>
        <h2 class="section-title">What we've already proven that applies directly to supply chain.</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Supply chains are networks of time-delayed causal dependencies. Our retail deployment already solved a miniature version of this exact problem.</p>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Time-Delayed Cascade Discovery: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>In retail, we found that changes in one department's metrics cascade into other departments with specific time delays (3 days, 10 days). Supply chains are fundamentally the same structure at larger scale: a disruption at a Tier 2 supplier cascades to Tier 1, then to the manufacturer, then to distribution, each with a measurable delay. This could apply to mapping these cascades across multi-tier supply networks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Hidden Cross-Category Dependencies: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>The retail deployment discovered that cigarette sales don't depend on cigarette demand. They depend on the interaction between vape volume and cigarillo traffic. Supply chains are full of analogous hidden dependencies: a semiconductor shortage doesn't just affect electronics. It affects automotive, medical devices, and industrial equipment through non-obvious pathways. This suggests we could uncover similar hidden pathways in supply networks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Leading Indicator Specificity: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>The platform doesn't just find correlations. It finds the specific metric, the specific direction of change, and the specific time delay. In retail, it found "disposable vape avg sale rises &rarr; store-wide avg sale follows in 3 days." This level of specificity suggests we could produce equally precise supply chain predictions: e.g., identifying that a drop in port throughput leads to increased parts lead time a set number of days later.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Pattern Detection: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>30,141 reinforcing patterns identified in baseball. Supply chains have their own reinforcing patterns: a delivery delay causes customers to double-order, which creates artificial demand, which causes further delays, which triggers more double-ordering. The bullwhip effect is a well-documented phenomenon. This suggests we could detect and model these automatically in supply chain data.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Multi-Factor Analysis: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>24% of relationships in baseball were compound interactions. Supply chain disruptions are rarely single-cause: a port strike combined with a weather event combined with a demand spike creates a compound impact far larger than any single factor alone. This suggests we could capture these compound disruption scenarios.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Per-Entity Risk Profiles: Already Proven</h3>
                <p>60 MLB players each received unique performance drivers. This proven capability could extend to per-supplier, per-route, and per-facility risk profiles that identify which specific nodes in a supply network are most vulnerable and why, without manual analysis of each one.</p>

        <h3 class="results-section-title">Where This Could Apply</h3>

        <div class="card-grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Bullwhip Effect Quantification</h3>
                <p>The bullwhip effect amplifies demand variability as it moves upstream. Based on proven results in time-delayed cascade discovery, we could quantify exactly how much amplification occurs at each tier for a specific supply chain, with enough precision to inform inventory policy at each node.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Port &amp; Shipping Lane Congestion Prediction</h3>
                <p>Vessel tracking data, port dwell times, and booking rates could serve as leading indicators for congestion events at specific ports. Proven ability to discover quantified time delays in other domains suggests it could identify these signals in shipping data.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Raw Material Price Transmission</h3>
                <p>How do commodity price shocks transmit to finished goods costs, and with what delay at each processing stage? Based on proven results, we could trace these transmission chains from raw material to end product with specific timing and magnitude for each link.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Supplier Financial Health Signals</h3>
                <p>Supplier bankruptcies don't happen overnight. Publicly available financial signals (payment delays, credit downgrades, executive departures) could serve as leading indicators for supplier reliability, giving procurement teams advance warning before a critical vendor fails. Proven leading-indicator discovery suggests it could identify these signals.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Geopolitical Risk Mapping</h3>
                <p>Trade policy changes, sanctions, and regional instability create supply chain risk. Proven ability to quantify causal relationships suggests it could measure how specific geopolitical events transmit to specific supply chain nodes, with measurable time delays and impact magnitudes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Last-Mile Delivery Optimization</h3>
                <p>Which factors actually drive last-mile delivery performance: weather, traffic patterns, driver experience, route density, or package volume? Based on proven results separating true drivers from noise in other domains, we could discover the specific drivers for specific delivery networks, moving beyond generic fleet management to data-driven route and capacity decisions.</p>
