        <h2 class="section-title">What we discovered across every industry.</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">The most valuable output isn't just accuracy numbers. It's the specific, actionable insights the platform uncovers that no one was looking for.</p>

                <div class="insight-domain">Baseball</div>
                <h3>Plate discipline, not swing mechanics, drives Aaron Judge's power</h3>
                <p>For every 1% reduction in chase rate, Judge's exit velocity increases by 9.5 mph. The platform identified discipline as the dominant lever: a coaching directive backed by 10 years of data.</p>

            <div class="insight-card">
                <div class="insight-domain">Baseball</div>
                <h3>Different players need completely different strategies</h3>
                <p>Judge's performance is driven by plate discipline. Mookie Betts' is driven by launch angle management. The platform discovered this automatically, proving it adapts to individuals without being told what to look for.</p>

                <div class="insight-domain">Retail</div>
                <h3>Products secretly drive each other's sales, and the platform finds which ones</h3>
                <p>Vape device transactions are driven by cigarillo traffic, not vape demand. Cigarette sales depend on a vape-cigarillo interaction. These hidden cross-sell dependencies change how you merchandise, promote, and plan inventory across departments.</p>
