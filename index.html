        <h2 class="section-title">The platform finds what no one was looking for.</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">The most valuable output isn't accuracy numbers. It's the specific, quantified mechanisms the platform discovers autonomously, with zero domain knowledge provided.</p>

                <div class="insight-domain">Baseball / Comprehensive Report</div>
                <h3>System discovered the causal chain of hitting from raw data alone</h3>
                <p>Across 60 players, the platform independently converged on a 4-layer causal model: Pitch Environment &rarr; Swing Decisions &rarr; Contact Quality &rarr; Outcomes. No baseball theory was provided. This is the same causal chain that sabermetrics has spent decades building. The system found it in hours.</p>

                <div class="insight-domain">Baseball / Comprehensive Report</div>
                <h3>30,141 feedback loops explain why hot streaks and slumps compound</h3>
                <p>The system detected self-reinforcing cycles: higher HR rate &rarr; higher SLG &rarr; pitchers throw more fastballs &rarr; more hittable pitches &rarr; even higher HR rate. It also found the slump spiral: higher K rate &rarr; expanded zone &rarr; worse contact &rarr; even higher K rate. 73,076 regime transitions (tipping points between streaks and slumps) were mapped across the roster.</p>

                <h3>24% of performance relationships are invisible to single-variable analysis</h3>
                <p>Of 156 discovered causal relationships, 37 were multi-factor compound interactions. Bobby Witt Jr.'s walk rate is jointly driven by pitch velocity trends and swing decision patterns. Neither alone is sufficient. Traditional regression models miss these entirely.</p>

                <h3>Luis Arraez: strikeout rate projected to four decimal places with zero error</h3>
                <p>The system produced a perfect K/PA projection for Arraez, identifying his extreme contact-first approach as the most stable, predictable signal in baseball. Cody Bellinger was projected at 99.0% accuracy. The system adapts to individuals without being told what type of player it's analyzing.</p>

                <p>When disposable vape average sale rises, the entire store's average sale follows 3 days later. Glass average sale is an even stronger signal at a 10-day lag, 2.2x more powerful. These are specific leading indicators with quantified time delays that no BI dashboard surfaces.</p>

                <h3>Cigarette sales don't depend on cigarette demand</h3>
                <p>Cigarette transactions are mathematically driven by the interaction between disposable vape volume and cigarillo traffic. If vape supply drops, cigarette baskets decline even if cigarette inventory is fully stocked. The platform maps hidden cross-department dependencies that rewrite how you plan inventory and supply chains.</p>

                <h3>0.02 percentage point error on the problem the entire industry has spent a decade trying to solve</h3>
                <p>Published readmission models achieve AUC of 0.60-0.76 and rate-level errors of 2-5 percentage points. A 2025 medRxiv study found no approach (ML, LLMs, or physician panels) achieved clinical-grade reliability. The platform predicted the 30-day readmission rate at 10.78% vs. 10.80% actual. 20x more accurate than the historical mean. 60x more accurate than naive persistence.</p>

                <h3>Independently discovered the primary readmission driver without clinical hypotheses</h3>
                <p>Given 126 clinical metrics and zero guidance, the platform identified high glucose prevalence adjusted by demographic factors as the dominant driver of 30-day readmission. This aligns with published clinical literature on hyperglycemia as a readmission risk factor. The system found what took clinical researchers years to establish.</p>

                <p>The discovered causal hierarchy, feedback loop mechanics, and compound interaction patterns in baseball translated directly into configuration improvements for other domains. Feedback loops in retail (cross-sell cascades) and healthcare (readmission spirals) follow the same mathematical structure the system first discovered in hitting performance.</p>
